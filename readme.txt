CHALLENGES FACED 
We faced a bit of trouble when the number of disks is not divisible by 3. And to display the status to each tower after each move was also very challenging for us.

HOW WE FACED THE CHALLENGES
We tried different ways and then worked together as a team on this assignment. We compiled all our ideas and worked on the coding and then tested with different cases.

WHAT WE LEARNT FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT
We learnt to work together coordinately. We learnt how to trace out through loops,recursion function and correct errors in the code. We also learnt how to make the problem simple using divide and conquer approach.
